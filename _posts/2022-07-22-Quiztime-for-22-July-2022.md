This was actually my first time completing a geolocation challenge, here are the steps I went through:
* I searched Google for the terms ""American Contract 516 326" as seen in the photo and then looked for locations in NY (516 area code).
* This lead me to American Rent-Alls Equipment, located at 10 Nassau Terminal Rd, New Hyde Park, NY 11040 (confirmed on Google Maps). 
* A search of the [Better Business Bureau] for the company lead to the business start date of **1964**.
* Lastly, a search for the address lead to a build date of **1952** via [LoopNet].
